# activities_vectors
    Mr.casseb requested the resolution of issues involving static vectors.
After reading the 4 questions and understanding what is asked in each question
I moved on to those that take less time to solve.

1) create a program with a vector of ages. The vector has the capacity to store 3
different ages. Add only 1 (one) initial value to the vector. The user must inform the
other values.

2) create a vector of 20 spaces. Each cell in the vector must store a random value of the
range 1~6.

3) create a vector to store up to 5 characters. The user must add the data but
the program must not allow repeated values.

4) Create a program in C. Start the program with a vector of integers of size 10 and
with the following menu with the young user:

    a) Print vector
Print the complete vector in GRID format.
    b) Generate randomly
In this option, the program fills the vector with random values ​​between 0 and
N. Where N is data provided by the user.
    c) Change value
    i) Add value
The user informs the position and the value he wants to add.
The vector only contains pairs.
The program warns if the vector position is occupied, and asks
confirmation:
(1) replace Yes?
(2) No

    ii) Remove value
(1) Remove by position
    In this option the user informs the position of the vector and the
program changes the current value to 0 (zero)
(2) Remove by value
    In this option, the user enters a value N and the program changes
by 0 (zero) all occurrences of N that are in the vector.

d) Exit the program
